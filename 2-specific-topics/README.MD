*This folder contains projects exploring focused Data Science/Machine Learning concepts.*  
*(e.g., text classification, automatic differentiation, neural network architectures)*  

### üß† What You'll Find Here:
- **Concept Deep Dives**: Notebooks dissecting specific ML/DS techniques
- **Experimental Approaches**: Different methods applied to the same problem

### üîç Sample Projects:
| Topic | Notebook | Key Libraries |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Autograd Mechanics | [`autograd-neural-network.ipynb`]() | NumPy, Matplotlib |
| Text Classification | [`text-classification.ipynb`]() | NLTK, TF-IDF, Scikit-learn |

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Use:
1. Pick a notebook matching your learning interest
2. Run cells sequentially (check dependency comments)
3. Experiment with hyperparameters in marked sections

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Want to Contribute?
